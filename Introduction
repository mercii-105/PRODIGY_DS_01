🎯 Goal:
Use Tableau to create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of the total population by country (or by year if you want time series).

Steps in Tableau
2️⃣ Open Tableau
Open Tableau Desktop (or Tableau Public if you don’t have Desktop).

3️⃣ Connect to your data
Click “Connect” → “Text file” → choose your CSV file.
Tableau will show you a preview. Make sure columns like Country Name, 2020, 2019 etc. are visible.

4️⃣ Make a Bar Chart (for categorical: countries)
Drag Country Name to Columns.
Drag e.g. 2020 to Rows.
If you want, click the Sort icon (looks like a little bar chart with an arrow) to sort from highest to lowest.

5️⃣ Make a Histogram (for continuous distribution)
If you want to see distribution of population values (like how many countries have 0-10M people, 10-20M, etc.):
Drag 2020 to Columns.
Click on the small dropdown on that field in Columns → select Histogram.
Tableau will automatically bin the data and create a histogram.
